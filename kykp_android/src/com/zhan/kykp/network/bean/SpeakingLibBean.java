For example, if emergencies happen and we need to drive someone to the hospital, or if some day I' m almost late for work and don' t have enough time to take public transportation. Also, when we' re moving from place to place, it would be nearly impossible to take public transportation. Plus, completely banning private cars in downtown might cause traffic situations in other areas since people will have to choose alternative ways to reach their destinations. \"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d25a3"},{"category":"TPO","updatedAt":1442963693,"task":"Task 1","repeatCount":3,"uid":761,"question":"Your university plans to open a caf√© inside the campus library.

First, it would be a great place to take a break from study, especially when exams are coming up. While getting refreshments, I could have some small talks with my friends in the study group. In this way, I wouldn' t get a headache from staring at the computer screen for several hours in a row. Also, it would be really convenient to get coffee. Often times I would feel really sleepy and tired in the morning. At this point, it would be awesome if I could easily grab a latte in the library on my way to the self-study room. The minute I take a sip of my coffee, I' m completely picked up and ready to start a new study session.\"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d25a2"},{"category":"TPO","updatedAt":1442963693,"task":"Task 2","repeatCount":3,"uid":760,"question":"\"Do you think that eating healthy food is easier or more difficult today than it \nwas 40 or 50 years ago?

Now that fast food is everywhere, I can' t help myself from going into those restaurants that serve fried chicken, burgers and pizza. When I don' t know what to eat for lunch, I would reach for McDonald' s next to my school. I have to admit that they' re really tasty, and I can never go wrong with a beef burger combo. However, in the past, there weren' t this many choices. Most people who earn a regular salary would cook at home, and it' s usually healthier\u2014at least the food wouldn' t be so greasy, and there would be more vegetables rather than meat. So I think it is becoming more difficult to eat healthy food right now.\"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d25a1"},{"category":"TPO","updatedAt":1442963693,"task":"Task 1","repeatCount":3,"uid":759,"question":"\"A friend of yours wants to go to university next year but cannot decide on a \nmajor field of study.

I mean, they' re the ones who are already involved in these majors,and they should have some first-hand information, like what classes they need to take, whether they' re interesting or not, and if this major is promising. When I graduated from high school, I hesitated between computer science and electronic engineering. I ended up majoring in EE, and find myself hate this major just because the classes I take are not the ones I thought I might be interested in. If I had the chance to ask some of the EE students before I entered college, I' m sure I wouldn' t have this kind of issue.\"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d25a0"},{"category":"TPO","updatedAt":1442963693,"task":"Task 2","repeatCount":3,"uid":758,"question":"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

I used to be paid for washing the dishes by my parents. They didn\u2019t pay me much though, I became really looking forward to doing the housework. Thus, these \u201clittle service tips\u201d really pushed me to get involved in trivial tasks. Also, kids would be given the chances to manage their own savings. For me, I was pretty excited about the fact that I do own a certain amount of money and learned to save it for different things: whether I would use it to make small purchases or save the money in bank.\"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d259f"},{"category":"TPO","updatedAt":1442963693,"task":"Task 1","repeatCount":3,"uid":757,"question":"Students often like to study with others in a group.

It greatly facilitates my interpersonal skills by granting more chances to talk with others members. You know, I used to be a very shy and introverted person. However, group study that I was involved for different subjects enables me discuss various topics such as ways to solve a particular math problems. In addition, group study enhances my efficacy and offers me broader views. For instance, once I and other members of economics class prepared for a research paper. If I work alone, it is very likely that it will take me 10 more days to gather related materials and 2 weeks to finish it. Nevertheless, with collective efforts, the whole group spent no more than a week to accomplish the paper.\"","examDate":"<null>","objectId":"5602516de4b043d0cb1d259e"}]
