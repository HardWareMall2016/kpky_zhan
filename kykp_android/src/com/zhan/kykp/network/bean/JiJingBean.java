I was almost 200 pounds last year and when I realized I had to lose weight, I started to play basketball. After a year, I've lost over 70 pounds. What a nice hit!

Firstly, it saves up time for surprises. It is understandable when some interesting places are first visited by travelers. These people surely have no plans for the visit, because there is no manual book to refer to, but the unexpected visit may make the whole trip marvelous. But this only happens when everything is settled, and we\u2019re in good mood for traveling rather than finding way for the next destination. Moreover, not everything can be planned beforehand, such as bad weather, traffic jam and car accident. When the plan is disturbed, the emotion is also ruined. Therefore, going straight to the destination is the most effective solution to less uncertainties on the road. \"","examDate":"2013/9/28","objectId":"56025165e4b043d0cb1d2347"},{"category":"机经口语","updatedAt":1442963685,"task":"Task 1","repeatCount":3,"uid":157,"question":"\"Describe a change in your country.

Firstly, children at 16 are physically mature and thus we assume they\u2019re also mentally responsible. Driving is an activity affecting not only the safety of the driver, but other road users, and if it is an irresponsible driver that is controlling the car, it is a bomb, sure to explode, but uncertain of the exact time. But usually, a 16 year-old youth has started to understand the essence of responsibility and therefore may be allowed to drive. Moreover, driving is a signal of grown-up and independence.
